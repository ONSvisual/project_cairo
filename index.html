    <li>Summarising content clearly, for high profile products such as the Insights tool or Economy roundup</li>
    <li>Supplementing publications with additional content, for example content for social media.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Collaborate: Initiating projects to create citizen-focused content</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Contributing ideas for analysis that will be of interest to a citizen audience</li>
    <li>Partnering with analytical teams to produce this content</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Innovate: Inventing and developing new products primarily for citizen users</h2>
  <p>These may include elements of:</p>
  <ul>
