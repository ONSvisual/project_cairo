  <h1>The Digital Content Team</h1>
  <p>Our team focuses on improving the understanding and engagement with ONS analysis.</p>
  <p>We offer a range of services in data visualisation, journalism, graphic design, content design and social media.</p>

  <p>We can help you select the most engaging format for presentation and structure the content to be suitable for all types of audiences, especially those from a non-statistical background, by communicating clearly the strengths and limitations of the data in an accessible, digestible way.</p>
  <p>You can contact us at <a href="mailto:digitalcontent@ons.gov.uk">digitalcontent@ons.gov.uk</a> and we will set up a consultation to see how we can best support you.</p>
  <p>Our services are broadly:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Presentational support and advice, including data vis consultation, style and format expertise from content design and editorial support from a journalist</li>

  <p>Our sister team is Publishing, which handles website publication, organisation, and essential publishing operations.</p>
  <p>Some projects will fall across more than one team. We will ensure that the people best suited to your content are working on it.</p>




  <p>Some formats require a different partnership and publication process. See our guidance on creating a digital content article and making a scrollytelling interactive article.</p>
  <p>We can also provide support and guidance on style and word count for statistical bulletins and standard analytical articles.</p>
